# hyper
An Api tooling service

## About
hyper aims to help you easily create backend API's for your application.

You will need to build the interface for your application yourself, or use something
like [shoelace](https://github.com/whiteboards/shoelace) (once it is ready). 

### Usage
First you need to install it with a simple git clone.

After that is done, you should do the following to get started:

`npm install`

`npm start`

This will start a server at `0.0.0.0:8081`

Navigate yourself to this URL and run through the wizard.

Plays nice with [hotel](https://github.com/typicode/hotel)

Right now this only works with mongo and mongoose. So be aware of that limitation.
